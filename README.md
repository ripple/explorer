# XRPL Explorer

This repo contains the source code for the block explorer of the XRP Ledger hosted at livenet.xrpl.org.

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). You can find information about how to use it [here](https://vitejs.dev/guide/cli.html).

## Basic requirements

### Install Node and NPM

The project requires node@22. Follow installation instructions on [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/).

(Recommended) Install using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

Make sure to use npm version 8+ by running `npm install -g npm@latest` after you install Node.

### Copy example env

`cp .env.example .env`

## Install, compile, and run

- `npm install` then
- `npm start` for development mode, or
- `npm run build` then `npm run prod-server` for production mode

### Installing on Apple Silicon

Since `canvas` does not provide pre-built binaries for Apple chips during `npm install` it will try to compile it manually. To get this to succeed you need to install several dependencies by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas#compiling).

## Running on Parallel Networks

### Testnet mode

1. Replace `VITE_RIPPLED_HOST=s2.ripple.com` with `VITE_RIPPLED_HOST=s.altnet.rippletest.net` in the `.env` file
1. Add `VITE_ENVIRONMENT=testnet` to `.env` to enable TESTNET banner

### Devnet mode

1. Replace `VITE_RIPPLED_HOST=s2.ripple.com` with `VITE_RIPPLED_HOST=s.devnet.rippletest.net` in the `.env` file
1. Add `VITE_ENVIRONMENT=devnet` to `.env` to enable TESTNET banner

## Testing

### Run unit tests

- Run tests in watch mode `npm test`
- Run test to produce coverage `npm run test:coverage`
- To open coverage HTML report in app root do `open coverage/index.html`

### Debugging Unit Tests in Chrome

1.  Place `debugger;` in your unit test
1.  Do `npm run test:debug`
1.  Open `about:inspect` in Chrome
1.  Click on `inspect` link
1.  Chrome Developer Tools will be open, click `play` button
1.  Now test will start running and will stop on your `debugger;`
1.  You know the rest ;)
