# XRPL Explorer

This repo contains the source code for the block explorer of the XRP Ledger hosted at livenet.xrpl.org.

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). You can find information about how to use it [here](https://vitejs.dev/guide/cli.html).

## Basic requirements

### Install Node and NPM

The project requires node@16. Follow installation instructions on [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/).

(Recommended) Install using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

Make sure to use npm version 8+ by running `npm install -g npm@latest` after you install Node.

### Google BigQuery Setup
This setup is required for the Tokens page of the explorer to function:

1.  [Select or create a Cloud Platform project][projects].
1.  [Enable the Google BigQuery API][enable_api].
1.  [Set up authentication with a service account][auth]

Once you have completed these steps and generated the JSON key file, you must populate the following environment variables in the .env file with their corresponding values from the JSON key file:
```
GOOGLE_APP_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
GOOGLE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY=-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...
GOOGLE_APP_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-client-email
```

### Copy example env

`cp .env.example .env`

## Install, compile, and run

* `npm install` then
* `npm start` for development mode, or
* `npm run build` then `npm run prod-server` for production mode

### Installing on Apple Silicon
Since `canvas` does not provide pre-built binaries for Apple chips during `npm install` it will try to compile it manually. To get this to succeed you need to install several dependencies by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas#compiling). 

## Running on Parallel Networks

### Testnet mode

1. Replace `VITE_RIPPLED_HOST=s2.ripple.com` with `VITE_RIPPLED_HOST=s.altnet.rippletest.net` in the `.env` file
1. Remove `VITE_RIPPLED_SECONDARY` from `.env` (optional, but the extra validator subscriptions are not necessary)
1. Add `VITE_ENVIRONMENT=testnet` to `.env` to enable TESTNET banner

### Devnet mode

1. Replace `VITE_RIPPLED_HOST=s2.ripple.com` with `VITE_RIPPLED_HOST=s.devnet.rippletest.net` in the `.env` file
1. Remove `VITE_RIPPLED_SECONDARY` from `.env` (optional, but the extra validator subscriptions are not necessary)
1. Add `VITE_ENVIRONMENT=devnet` to `.env` to enable TESTNET banner

## Testing

### Run unit tests

* Run tests in watch mode `npm test`
* Run test to produce coverage `npm run test:coverage`
* To open coverage HTML report in app root do `open coverage/index.html`

### Debugging Unit Tests in Chrome

1.  Place `debugger;` in your unit test
1.  Do `npm run test:debug`
1.  Open `about:inspect` in Chrome
1.  Click on `inspect` link
1.  Chrome Developer Tools will be open, click `play` button
1.  Now test will start running and will stop on your `debugger;`
1.  You know the rest ;)
